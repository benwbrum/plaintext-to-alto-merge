Mr.  P.C. Cameron

Dear Sir

Our Salesman Mr Pullen
reported to us Sep 26th that he made an error
of 15 lbs in the weight of the Bbl Sugar
which he sold to you at that time
He charged you for 231 lbs instead of
246 lbs the right weight. The 231 was
the number of the Bbl not the N"[Number] of lbs of
Sugar as you will find by examining
the head of the Bbl.
Respectfully
BP Williamson Co.
