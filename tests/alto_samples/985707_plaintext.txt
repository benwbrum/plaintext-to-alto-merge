[1865]

My dear Annie,

I write a line
by Jesse, to beg you if you have
already gotten the "Carbonate
of Potash &c which Sall
wrote for, by Mr. Curtis' plan
to return them to the Drug
store-- Mama does not need
them now, & I am sure Col.
Webb would not object to
taking them back-- Please
attend to it at once dear
Annie-- Papa has no acct
at the Drug Store, & Mama does
not wish to commence one--
with best love to all believe
me

most affectionately
Yours

Patsy R-
