acquainted on the cars they are
also in this house so I have one
lady acquaintance-- take our trip
so far we have been very fortunate
& I feel very grateful to have gotten
here safely. I was very much frighten
in Chattanooga & the gentleman told
me next day that they were frighten
too altho they appeared very indifferent
at the time. There seemed so much
excitement & the Yankees & Tories
went singing all kind of Yankee
Songs about the streets & shooting
all night they marched several
times around the hotel we were in
& it was thought would force an
entrance but they did not & we
got through xmas eve safely--
Annie has made a great many
friends & every body has petted fed &
played with her so far she has
resisted all advances from Yankees
