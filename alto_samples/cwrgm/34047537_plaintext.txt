Carrollton, May 15th 1876

Governor Stone

Dear Sir

Some days ago I signed a Peti-tion recommending my friend Lee Mc1Millan as one suitable person to appoint on the Board of Registrars for this County. I do not intend to recall that, or in any case qualify it; and do not write you to so understand this letter. But I now write on the sug-gestion of Several of our friends to make this sugges-tionâ€” Viz: For you to delay action a little, until We have a sort of conference among ourselves as to a proper board. We do this believing that you will be glad to have something like a general ex-pression of Opinion from prominent and good citizens. Hoping that you fully appreciate the motives and designs of this note.

I am, as ever,
Yours Very Truly

A. M. Nelson
