The Honorable M. Claire,
Port Jackson,
July 29th, 182.

Sir,

I have the honor to inform your Excellency of my arrival in the "Harrappen" as above, and in obedience to your Excellency's orders, I beg leave to report as follows:

Having delivered the provisions and stores for Newcastle and the Commandant at that station, I proceeded with all possible despatch along the coast to the northeast and arrived at the latitude of 28.30 degrees south. None of the "Hunters," the Five Islands Group, then became the object of my earnest investigation. From this latitude to Point Danger, the land is high with sandy beaches in front, extending for some miles and clear of danger, without any openings or places of shelter. But there is a small island, which can be seen to the south of the only one off it, and the parts to the eastward of it form a channel of about three miles wide, perfectly safe for coasting vessels, and causing the land to appear as an island, and steering in about south-east.

The "Russell's" are a set of dangerous shoals and reefs stretching from the island about three miles and extending as far as they appear to occupy a space of about a mile in a north-northeasterly direction.

From Point Danger, a few miles to the northward, the land is very high, with a low sandy beach in front, and then within a mile of Point Lookout, low sandy land. The whole space between these two points forms one continued, both mainland and beach, with regular landings, and the whole is, within one mile of the Thames. It is perfectly safe to approach.

I have the honor to be,
With the greatest respect,
Your Excellency's most obedient and humble servant,

Mason,
Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.B.
Governor in Chief and Commander-in-Chief.
