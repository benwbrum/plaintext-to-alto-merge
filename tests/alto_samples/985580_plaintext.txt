Rebecca as soon as I can-- I shall
have a great deal to do now for
some little time to come.  I
wonder if the father is with you--
how very much I miss you all &
the dear little children-- Do give
my best love to Mr. Cameron &
every one of the family & kisses to
the children & love for the Curtis'
& all  my friends-- I was so sorry to miss Dr. Curtis - My homespuns
are thought very pretty indeed.

I suppose Rebecca will be in
Raleigh very soon-- do let me hear
when you get any tidings from
Mary. There are many things
I wish to say, but it is so late--
