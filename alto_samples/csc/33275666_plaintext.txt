With the greatest respect to himself His Excellency
and his high Office decline however
to accede to that suggestion --

If I am to be supported as the
head of my Department, I submit
to His Excellency that no subordinate
Officer, should be allowed to act as he
has done, and his conduct would
have been laid before His Excellency
and the Executive Council this morning
had not my Knowledge of the infirmity
of his temper and a charitable feeling
towards his wife, who in the event
of his losing his situation would be
penniless induced me to take no
notice of the insult --  In explanation
however of my refusal to communicate
with him I have been obliged to disclose
his conduct.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your most Obd. Servt.
Ratcliffe Pring
Attorney General

[Margin]
I think the Attorney General is
quite right.   Let the
matter rest.
Decr.  31/59.     G F B.
