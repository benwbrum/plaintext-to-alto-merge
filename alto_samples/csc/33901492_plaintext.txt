60/186

Police Office
Ipswich, 23rd Jan. 1860.

Sir,
I have the honor of for-
warding for your information an application I received
two days since from the Chief Con-
stable of this District, shewing the
necessity of an increase to the Police
Force here.
2. The statement made by the
Chief Constable is strictly in accord-
ance with the truth, and I may
add that during the day, I have only
been able to put one man on patriol
duty for the purpose of preserving
the peace of the Town, which you
must allow is inadequate for that
purpose.
3. Under these circumstances
therefore I feel it to be my duty
to

The Inspector General of Police
Brisbane
