Suggesting alterations of the Polling
days for West Moreton


Ipswich 11th July 1860

The Honble
The Colonial Secretary
Queensland

Sir,

We do ourselves the honor
to call your attention to the small time
that intervened between the days of
nomination and the day of Election
for the District of West Moreton.

Some of the polling places are thirty
forty and even sixty miles off from
Ipswich which will render it diffcult
for the chief returning officer to com-
municate with his deputies in time.

Believing that his Excellency has
power to remedy this we beg you will
bring the same under his notice.

We beg also to call your attention
to the fact that Alfred and Biggs Camp
both names as polling places on the
Drayton road are only four miles
apart, we think one or other might
be dispensed with.

A polling place either near
Wagaroo or near Redbank we consider
should be an accommodation to the
voters in that neighbourhood, and to
those residing at Brisbane.

We have the honor to be
Sir
Your obt Servants

John Kent
Alfred D Broughton
