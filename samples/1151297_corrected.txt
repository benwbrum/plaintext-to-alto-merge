Tunica Co. Sept 11th 59

Mr. Cameron

Dear Sir

Since my last there has been considerable
sickness more than any week
previous though nothing serious except
in the case of Evaline who had an attac
of coly morbus which might have been
a bad case if she had not been relieved of
the other cases slight Billous attacs
and chills & fever no one
sick much at this time. My wife was
sick last week with a sort of
nervious billous attac. She is up,
Bob has had chills.

No perceviable change in the crop.
There has been two much rain & cloudy
weather, the extent of the crop depends
greatly on the season from this out the cotton
is large and if there should be a great deal
of rain and cloudy weather cotton will not
open, work has been picking cotton working
on building ditching & no particular trouble
with the hands except this awkwardness
in building all Humble and obedient, stock
all doing well, Respectfully yours W. T. Lamb
