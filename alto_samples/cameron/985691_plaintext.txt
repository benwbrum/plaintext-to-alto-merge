I think I can get labour enough after
a little while as the rush will then
be over & I find little disposition on the
part of Planters to exceed my terms--
I have purchased 12 very fine mules for
which I gave $2300.00 & they are rising in
value all the time the only objection I find
to them is want of age they are only 4
years old in the Spring & only 4 of them are
broken-- but it was the best I could do-- I
talked to several dealers from Kentucky & Indiana
all of them were anxious to bring me mules
but would not agree to furnish the class I
wanted for less than $225-- a head & these
only 3 year olds. I hope I shall be able to
get on with these by great care
& not working
them too hard for the 1st year. Every thing here is very high
at least double what it was before the war--
& I have been much pressed for
money My
merchants agreed to advance $150000 the Cotton
sold for only $67500 after all charges were paid
the weights were  too light not averageing 400
& the sample bad, full of dirt &c. & the market
at the time of sale being dull though rather
